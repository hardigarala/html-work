   <h1> Objects in JavaScript are fundamental data structures that store collections of key-value pairs, 
    known as properties. 
    <br>Here's a breakdown of key concepts:<br></h1>
<h2>1. Object Creation:<br>
Object Literals: Defined using curly braces {} with comma-separated key-value pairs.<br>
JavaScript<br></h2>

   <h2> const person = {<br>
      name: "John",<br>
      age: 30,<br>
      city: "New York"<br>
   };<br>
Object Constructor: Created using the new Object() syntax, though less common than literals.<br>

JavaScript <br></h2>

   <h2> const person = new Object();<br>
    person.name = "John";<br>
    person.age = 30;<br>
Constructor Functions: Functions used to create objects with similar properties.<br>
JavaScript<br>

    function Person(name, age) {<br>
      this.name = name;<br>
      this.age = age;<br>
    }<br>
    const person1 = new Person("John", 30);<br>
Object.create(): Creates a new object with a specified prototype.<br>
JavaScript<br>

    const proto = { greet: function() { console.log("Hello"); } };<br>
    const obj = Object.create(proto);<br>
</h2>

 <h2>2. Properties: <br>
Key-value pairs where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be any data type (numbers, strings, objects, functions, etc.).<br>
Accessed using dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation (object['property']).<br> Bracket notation is necessary when keys are not valid identifiers or are stored in variables.<br>
Properties can be added, changed, or deleted dynamically.</h2><br>
  <h2>3. Methods:<br>
Functions that are properties of an object. They perform actions associated with the object.<br>
Accessed using dot or bracket notation and called like regular functions (object.method()).<br>
The this keyword within a method refers to the object the method belongs to.<br></h2>
  <h2>4. Prototypes:
Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, which is another object.<br>
Objects inherit properties and methods from their prototypes.<br>
The prototype chain allows for code reuse and inheritance.<br>
The Object.prototype is the ultimate prototype for all objects.</h2>
 <h2>
<!-- 5. Key Object Methods:
Object.keys(object): Returns an array of an object's keys.<br>
Object.values(object): Returns an array of an object's values.<br>
Object.entries(object): Returns an array of key-value pairs.<br>
Object.assign(target, ...sources): Copies properties from source objects to a target object. <br>
Object.is(value1, value2): Checks if two values are the same.<br></h2>
<h2>
6. Object Mutability:
Objects are mutable: Changes to an object affect all references to it.<br>
Assigning an object to a new variable does not create a copy, but rather a reference.<br></h2>
<h2>
7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
JavaScript is a prototype-based OOP language.<br>
Objects are used to represent real-world entities.<br>
Concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism can be implemented using objects.<br></h2>
<h2>
8. Built-in Objects:
JavaScript has built-in objects like Array, Date, Math, and String, each with specific properties and methods.<br>
These objects are instances of the Object type.<br>
In summary, objects in JavaScript are versatile and powerful tools for storing and manipulating data. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effective JavaScript development.<br></h2> -->
